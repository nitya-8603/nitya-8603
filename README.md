   Hi there!! Good to see you here. ðŸ‘‹

- I love building apps with Flutter and Dart that work beautifully on any device.

- Coding in Java, especially solving puzzles with data structures and algorithms, is my favorite way to learn.

- Iâ€™m always up for a good hackathon or coding contestâ€”they help me grow and meet awesome people.

- Turning rough ideas into real, working apps is what keeps me motivated.

- I like making things simpleâ€”both in my code and in my solutions to tricky problems.

- Making sure apps are both easy to use and good looking is something I care about.
