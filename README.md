## Hi there 👋

<!--
**nitya-8603/nitya-8603** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- I love building apps with Flutter and Dart that work beautifully on any device.

- Coding in Java, especially solving puzzles with data structures and algorithms, is my favorite way to learn.

- I’m always up for a good hackathon or coding contest—they help me grow and meet awesome people.

- Turning rough ideas into real, working apps is what keeps me motivated.

- I like making things simple—both in my code and in my solutions to tricky problems.

- Making sure apps are both easy to use and good looking is something I care about.
